I used Radu Mariescu Istodor's physics function to detect collisions here. This is a prototype game of my game engine. You can made objects and add assets, gravity or jumping height to object in just one object constructor. You can made varius games via this game engine. I tried to make minecraft with perlin noise algorithm here.
